ABC soup is one of my favorite comfort foods. It has lots of tasty veggies, packed with vitamins **A** (carrots), **B** (potatoes), and **C** (tomatoes). And it's as easy to make as the ABCs:

1. Blanch pork ribs or bone-in chicken thighs. After boiling, drain and rinse the meat under cold water.
2. Chop and add potatoes, carrots, onions, celery, sweet corn, tomatoes, and garlic to the pot. Add water.
3. Bring to a boil and then simmer for an hour.
4. Add salt and white pepper to taste at the end.

My aunt used to cook ABC soup for my cousins and me when I lived in Singapore. I still remember my younger cousin adding white pepper (and maybe coriander) as his "magic touch" to elevate the flavor. Fun times.

Here I am on Chinese New Year's Eve in Cambridge, having ABC soup with Eric and ML. We also have dumplings, smashed cucumber salad, roasted lamb chops, some fruit, a durian cake, and a bottle of wine which Kevin sent from London. Together we watch the *Spring Festival Gala*, which features Harbin as one of the sub-venues. 

I had the greatest childhood in Harbin and amazing student years in Singapore. My time in Cambridge has felt a bit less eventful, with research and solitude filling chunks of time. The blank spaces have given room to reflection and nostalgia. The heavy weight of time is starting to sink in, stripping away the child and the student within me and imposing a new sense of responsibility. I'm horrified by the deadlines I'd never want to think of. I wonder where life will take me.

I hope I will cook many ABC soups for them.
