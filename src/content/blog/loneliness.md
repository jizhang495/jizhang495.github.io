It's a quarter past midnight, and the feeling has come to me--the exact feeling that has haunted me since I started living alone: loneliness.

I picked up my phone. I want to talk to someone. But who? It's past midnight and I don't want my parents to know I am sleeping late. How about texting a friend? What should I say? I am lonely? That would be so weird. I would be more comfortable talking about nerd topics but that won't cure my loneliness. 

How about some entertainment: short form videos, games, live streams, pornography, social media...? Trust me, they don't relieve loneliness. They only help me forget it--until it's late enough that sleep becomes the only option. As for long-form videos, films, books..., at this point I feel I don't have that much time to allocate to these stuff, although short videos would end up consuming even more time. 

Now with the advent of technology I can find people online to talk to, on dating apps etc. But over time I find that exhausting too. Not everyone is friendly there, and many are not interested in talking to me. It is always rare to get a fulfilling conversation with strangers, be it online or in person. The conversations could be fun or informative, but rarely help with my loneliness issue. 

We have another option now called the AI chatbot. The benefit of talking to an LLM is that I can say whatever I want without being judged and get an intelligent, supportive response. I totally love doing that. But something is still missing. I somehow miss the imperfection and unpredictability of human responses, just like how people prefer live concerts over CD recordings. 

It seems as if the best solution is to find a girlfriend. Of course it is! That would have solved all my problems, or may create new problems that I don't know of yet. I've stayed single most of my life, and I have been quite picky. And since I am thinking of potential future marriage now, I have become even more picky. And I may well stay single for the next 5 years.

So how to cope with this excruciating loneliness? 

# Continuity of Life

I have come to realize that the continuity of memory may be the essence of life. Depending on the level of abstraction, the answer to the philosophical question of "who am I" may be (1) my brain, (2) the topology and weights of neurons in my brain, or (3) the collection of all past events in my memory. I don't know how 30 years of my personal history could be compressed in such a compact space, but I'm sure it feels continuous, flowing like a river. An LLM in 2026 doesn't have its own story--it can memorize a lot of people's stories, or be fed with a persona document in its context window, but such fragmented stories would feel nowhere as real as mine. That difference between stored text and lived continuity may be why AI conversation comforts me without fully curing loneliness.

In light of this, being lonely may well be the natural state of life. If I am the only one in the world feeling this continuous flow of events and storing them in a low-entropy state in my brain, I would be lonely for sure. Loneliness decreases only when someone who can also feel the continuity crosses path with me, so that both of our continuities share a same story segment. And loneliness is minimized if we feel the story in the same way, or if they are as important in my story as I am in theirs. 

As a civilization, our collective life is potentially infinite, and maybe loneliness is less of a concern if the continuity of memory can extend to infinity. Or maybe, infinite time is giving infinite hope of meeting infinitely many other civilizations in the universe. 

As an individual, my life is finite, and loneliness does become a concern, because my time with people I love will be limited--there is an urgency to maximize such overlaps in continuity.

# Hierarchy of Experiences

As an individual with finite time living in a world with other individuals with finite times, I yearn for eternity for my loved ones and myself, just like how ancient Egyptians preserved their bodies in pyramids. Whether building something that lasts, making recorded achievements, or even just taking pictures or writing blogposts, we want to leave an indelible mark in history, as if we are talking to someone in the future, as a intertemporal connection that alleviates our loneliness. And I do wish my favorite bygone authors and artists hear how I feel about their work. However, it is important to note that in practice, after I die, my continuity of life stops, and there will be infinite possibilities how future unfolds, which I can't do any action to affect anymore. 

Now I want to experience my finite life in a desirable way. There are many ways to play the game of life, and the only real failure is playing it as if it were about winning. I don't want to optimize for money, fame, power, or sex. I don't want to go on a hedonic treadmill (think of *Wolf of Wall Street*). What kind of life do I really want?

It seems to me that the meaning of life--the ultimate philosophical question--is somehow linked to the notion of loneliness too. Conquering loneliness seems to be a goal, if not *the* goal, of life. It's such a lifey thing to coauthor a narrative with another sentient being in the stream of space-time.

But not all narratives feel equal, and it depends on the level of participation in these narratives. I like to think of my life experiences and interactions in 5 tiers in order of depth, continuity, and reciprocity:

- Tier 1: Irreplaceable, identity forming bonds in which both care about each other unconditionally (e.g., parents, children, ideal spouse)
- Tier 2: Non-transactional companionship where both can laugh together from the bottom of hearts (e.g., genuine friends, close relatives)
- Tier 3: Intrapersonal exploration that refines perception and brings warmth and resonance to solitude (e.g., books, movies, music, art, science; interacting with kind people around the world; talking to AI)
- Tier 4: Transactional relationships, fame, money, and power that are tools for survival and for enhancing tier 1-3 experiences
- Tier 5: Fleeting dopamine escapes (e.g., drugs, gambling, impulsive sexual encounters, uninformative doomscrolling)

The higher the tier, the more nourishing the experience is, and the more it increases happiness and decreases loneliness.

# What Next

Understanding life, happiness, and loneliness requires a lifelong journey of exploration, pondering, and introspection. I don't know how the world and my life will unfold in the future, but it is clear that I should protect my Tier 1 experiences, maintain consistent Tier 2 experiences, and use Tier 3 experiences to fill the gaps. When I am single, staying far away from parents, having busy friends or busy schedule myself, I guess Tier 3 experiences are my solitude coping mechanism, and blog writing should belong to this category.

Today I am writing this post to myself, as a snapshot of my life. I am talking to myself, my greatest listener ever, whom my continuity of life overlap 100% with. (And possibly taking to my future self who may find this post naive af.) But I do feel a bit of catharsis now, as if I am not lonely anymore. For now, this is one way I'm learning to be self-sufficient.
